## 01.01.2017 - Let's Get Started!

Hello 1PPM Community,

Today (8AM), we are already counting 135 forks of the 1PPM Log repository. This means, the 1PPM community could create up to **1620 new projects** in 2017! Now that would be exciting!

Thanks to your engagement, 1PPM even made it to the [GitHub trending page](https://github.com/trending) yesterday. Don't forget to star and tell your friends, maybe we can do that again.

For my 01/2017 project, I am going to create a first version of a 1ppm.club website. Minimum: *A JavaScript Page with the HallOfFame page as its "Backend", hosted on Github Pages, live by Jan 31 (latest).* (see [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/1ppm/1ppmLog/issues/9)). Collaborators are welcome, just contact me via [1ppm@1ppm.club](mailto:1ppm@1ppm.club) or [chat]((https://gitter.im/1ppm/challenge)).

Also, I am announcing an open **1PPM logo design contest** since Scott Hutchenson challenged my mighty MS Paint skills with his fancy photoshopping:

<img src="logo/1PPM_Logo.png" width="200" height="150" />
<img src="logo/scott_hutchensen.jpg" width="200" height="150" />

Simply add your submissions to the "logo" folder with name/nickname as filename or post a logo on twitter (make sure to mention @1ppmclub). **Voting starts on Jan. 7**, probably via Twitter survey.

Happy new year and keep going:  
Set a goal, build, release, learn, repeat :)

Regards,  
Gerhard

## 01.01.2017 - POD, Slack, project ideas

Hello 1PPM Community,

 As announced, the 1PPM Bot (which is me at first) will publish new projects via [@1ppmclub](https://twitter.com/1ppmclub) and later in Slack (see issue [#23](https://github.com/1ppm/1ppmLog/issues/23)). Probably in the evening (CET) when he has the time ;) Everyday the Bot will pick one or more projects as "project(s) of the day" (#POD) so that everyone can be POD once a month. Feel free to discuss the project ideas, offer contributions and ask for advice, there will be a #pod channel in Slack. (Please be kind, find some tips on giving feedback [here](https://www.roberthalf.com/creativegroup/blog/7-tips-on-giving-feedback-to-employees))

 As mentioned before, we are moving from gitter to Slack, reasons see [#23](https://github.com/1ppm/1ppmLog/issues/23). I am working on an easier invitation method, early adopters can contact me via email ([1ppm@1ppm.club](mailto:1ppm@1ppm.club), Subject: Slack).

There are two 1PPM ideas open for volunteers who are  looking for projects: [#38](https://github.com/1ppm/1ppmLog/issues/38) a 1ppm Bot and [#39](https://github.com/1ppm/1ppmLog/issues/39) a HallOfFame to JSON parser. Questions and voluntary notifications in the issue tracker.

Gerhard

## 02.01.2017 - 1ppm.club

Hello 1PPM Community,

Woha, 150 forks and counting! So we are looking forward to **1800+ new projects** in 2017? Now that would be something!

Also, almost 40 challengers have already entered the hall of fame. Lots of great stuff there, go have a look around!

In the meantime, I've set up a landing page for [1ppm.club](http://1ppm.club). However, there were some problems with the hexo-excerpt plugin. Any help in this matter would be appreciated, simply contact 1ppm in Slack.

Have a productive week,

Regards,
Gerhard
