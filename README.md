# The 1PPM Challenge

"One Project per Month" is a challenge for developers, makers and creatives. Its about accelerated learning, avoiding over engineering and getting things done. Find out more about the 1PPM in "[The 1PPM-Challenge](https://medium.com/1ppm/the-1ppm-challenge-eaed5df0ef5a#.oejtaqmy0)"

## Get Started!

Here is an Article on how to come up with project ideas: "[12 Months / 12 Side Projects - Are you in?](https://medium.com/@gerji/12-months-12-side-projects-are-you-in-c395dbcd648e#.qle34253j)". Note that 1PPM projects can be anything, as long as it has a result, you learned something and is a one month project. So it could be an article, an online course certificate, a github project etc. Contributions to [open source projects](https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/how-to-contribute-to-open-source)  are especially welcome!


To get started:

0. Create a GitHub account if needed
1. Fork this repository ("Fork" Button in the top right corner)
2. Start a new section in [HallOfFame.md](HallOfFame.md) with your name/nickname as title, a twitter handle if present and add a description of your projects. Add a link to GitHub repository, Website, Blog etc if present. You can simpy use the GitHub editor to edit in your browser:

## 03.01.2017 - 1PPM Rocket Launcher

Hello 1PPM Community,

Just a few days, and 1PPM already inspired me to yet another side-side-...project. I'm presenting you : project **[Rocket Launch](https://github.com/1ppm/RocketLaunch)** . It's about providing motivation and inspiration, encouraging and boosting project launches.

 Also, since 1PPM is step by step attracting new members and twitter followers, this should give **you** the chance harness the **power of the community** for your promising projects (so bring your friends in ;)).

 I hope that "Rocket Launch" will eventually attract new club members, which will make the Rocket Launcher more powerfull and so on. You see where this is going :)

Have a look at the project, contribute and discuss with me via [1ppm@1ppm.club](mailto:1ppm@1ppm.club) and slack about it!

**Note:** Please do not post about Rocket Launch on Hacker News etc. yet. When it's time, Rocket Launch is going to launch itself, now how cool is that ;)

Regards,  
Gerhard
