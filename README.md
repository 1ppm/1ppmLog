# The 1PPM Challenge

1PPM is a challenge for developers, makers and creatives. Its about accelerated learning, avoiding over engineering and getting things done. Find out more about the 1PPM in "[The 1PPM-Challenge](https://medium.com/1ppm/the-1ppm-challenge-eaed5df0ef5a#.oejtaqmy0)"

## Get Started!

Here is an Article on how to come up with project ideas: "[12 Months / 12 Side Projects - Are you in?](https://medium.com/@gerji/12-months-12-side-projects-are-you-in-c395dbcd648e#.qle34253j)". Note that a 1PPM project can be anything, as long as it has a result, you learned something and is a one month project. So it could be an article, an online course certificate, a github project etc. Contributions to [open source projects](https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/how-to-contribute-to-open-source)  are especially welcome!


To get started:

0. Create a GitHub account if needed
1. Fork this repository ("Fork" Button in the top right corner)
2. Start a new section in [HallOfFame.md](HallOfFame.md) with your name/nickname as title, a twitter handle if present and add a description of your projects. Add a link to GitHub repository, Website, Blog etc if present. You can simpy use the GitHub editor to edit in your browser:

3. Make a [pull request](http://kbroman.org/github_tutorial/pages/fork.html) to merge your changes back
4. Join 1ppm on [Slack](https://1ppmclub.slack.com) - until auto-invite is working, you can request an invite via mail [1ppm@1ppm.club](mailto:1ppm@1ppm.club), Subject "Slack Access".

For any questions or feedback, contact [1ppm@1ppm.club](mailto:1ppm@1ppm.club). You can also follow [@1ppmclub](https://twitter.com/1ppmclub) on twitter, all new projects will be published there.

## 01.01.2017 - Let's Get Started!

Hello 1PPM Community,

Today (8AM), we are already counting 135 forks of the 1PPM Log repository. This means, the 1PPM community could create up to **1620 new projects** in 2017! Now that would be exciting!

Thanks to your engagement, 1PPM even made it to the [GitHub trending page](https://github.com/trending) yesterday. Don't forget to star and tell your friends, maybe we can do that again.

For my 01/2017 project, I am going to create a first version of a 1ppm.club website. Minimum: *A JavaScript Page with the HallOfFame page as its "Backend", hosted on Github Pages, live by Jan 31 (latest).* (see [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/1ppm/1ppmLog/issues/9)). Collaborators are welcome, just contact me via [1ppm@1ppm.club](mailto:1ppm@1ppm.club) or [chat]((https://gitter.im/1ppm/challenge)).

Also, I am announcing an open **1PPM logo design contest** since Scott Hutchenson challenged my mighty MS Paint skills with his fancy photoshopping:

<img src="logo/1PPM_Logo.png" width="200" height="150" />
<img src="logo/scott_hutchensen.jpg" width="200" height="150" />

Simply add your submissions to the "logo" folder with name/nickname as filename or post a logo on twitter (make sure to mention @1ppmclub). **Voting starts on Jan. 7**, probably via Twitter survey.

Happy new year and keep going:  
Set a goal, build, release, learn, repeat :)

Regards,  
Gerhard

## 01.01.2017 - POD, Slack, project ideas

Hello 1PPM Community,

 As announced, the 1PPM Bot (which is me at first) will publish new projects via [@1ppmclub](https://twitter.com/1ppmclub) and later in Slack (see issue [#23](https://github.com/1ppm/1ppmLog/issues/23)). Probably in the evening (CET) when he has the time ;) Everyday the Bot will pick one or more projects as "project(s) of the day" (#POD) so that everyone can be POD once a month. Feel free to discuss the project ideas, offer contributions and ask for advice, there will be a #pod channel in Slack. (Please be kind, find some tips on giving feedback [here](https://www.roberthalf.com/creativegroup/blog/7-tips-on-giving-feedback-to-employees))

 As mentioned before, we are moving from gitter to Slack, reasons see [#23](https://github.com/1ppm/1ppmLog/issues/23). I am working on an easier invitation method, early adopters can contact me via email ([1ppm@1ppm.club](mailto:1ppm@1ppm.club), Subject: Slack).

There are two 1PPM ideas open for volunteers who are  looking for projects: [#38](https://github.com/1ppm/1ppmLog/issues/38) a 1ppm Bot and [#39](https://github.com/1ppm/1ppmLog/issues/39) a HallOfFame to JSON parser. Questions and voluntary notifications in the issue tracker.

Gerhard

## 02.01.2017 - 1ppm.club

Hello 1PPM Community,

Woha, 150 forks and counting! So we are looking forward to **1800+ new projects** in 2017? Now that would be something!

Also, almost 40 challengers have already entered the hall of fame. Lots of great stuff there, go have a look around!

In the meantime, I've set up a landing page for [1ppm.club](http://1ppm.club). However, there were some problems with the hexo-excerpt plugin. Any help in this matter would be appreciated, simply contact 1ppm in Slack.

Have a productive week,

Regards,
Gerhard

## 03.01.2017 - 1PPM Rocket Launcher

Hello 1PPM Community,

Just a few days, and 1PPM already inspired me to yet another side-side-...project. I'm presenting you : project **[Rocket Launch](https://github.com/1ppm/RocketLaunch)** . It's about providing motivation and inspiration, encouraging and boosting project launches.

 Also, since 1PPM is step by step attracting new members and twitter followers, this should give **you** the chance harness the **power of the community** for your promising projects (so bring your friends in ;)).

 I hope that "Rocket Launch" will eventually attract new club members, which will make the Rocket Launcher more powerfull and so on. You see where this is going :)

Have a look at the project, contribute and discuss with me via [1ppm.club](http://1ppm.club) and slack about it!

**Note: Please do not post about Rocket Launch on Hacker News etc.** When it's time, Rocket Launch is going to be launched...via Rocket Launch (launching itself, now how cool is that ;)

Regards,  
Gerhard
