# The 1PPM Challenge

"One Project per Month" is a challenge for developers, makers and creatives. It's about accelerated learning, avoiding over engineering and getting things done. Find out more about the 1PPM in "[The 1PPM-Challenge](https://medium.com/1ppm/the-1ppm-challenge-eaed5df0ef5a#.oejtaqmy0)"

## Get Started!

Here is an article on how to come up with project ideas: "[12 Months / 12 Side Projects - Are you in?](https://medium.com/@gerji/12-months-12-side-projects-are-you-in-c395dbcd648e#.qle34253j)". Note that 1PPM projects can be anything, as long as it has a result, you learned something and it is a one month project. So it could be an article, an online course certificate, a github project etc. Contributions to [open source projects](https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/how-to-contribute-to-open-source)  are especially welcome!


To get started:

0. Create a GitHub account if needed
1. Fork this repository ("Fork" Button in the top right corner)
2. Start a new section in [HallOfFame.md](HallOfFame.md) with your name/nickname as title, a twitter handle if present and add a description of your projects. Add a link to GitHub repository, Website, Blog etc if present. You can simpy use the GitHub editor to edit in your browser:

3. Make a [pull request](http://kbroman.org/github_tutorial/pages/fork.html) to merge your changes back
