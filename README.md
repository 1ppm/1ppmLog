# The 1PPM Challenge

1PPM is a challenge for developers, makers and creatives. Its about accelerated learning, avoiding over engineering and getting things done. Find out more about the 1PPM in "[The 1PPM-Challenge](https://medium.com/1ppm/the-1ppm-challenge-eaed5df0ef5a#.oejtaqmy0)"

## Get Started!

Here is an Article on how to come up with project ideas: "[12 Months / 12 Side Projects - Are you in?](https://medium.com/@gerji/12-months-12-side-projects-are-you-in-c395dbcd648e#.qle34253j)". Note that a 1PPM project can be anything, as long as it has a result, you learned something and is a one month project. So it could be an article, an online course certificate, a github project etc. Contributions to open [open source projects](https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/how-to-contribute-to-open-source)  are especially welcome! 


To get started:

1. Fork this repository
2. Start a new section in [HallOfFame.md](HallOfFame.md) with your name/nickname as title and add a description of your projects + links to repository or articles  
3. Make a [pull request](http://kbroman.org/github_tutorial/pages/fork.html) to merge your changes back

For any questions or feedback, contact [1ppm@1ppm.club](mailto:1ppm@1ppm.club). You can also follow [@1ppmclub](https://twitter.com/1ppmclub) on twitter, all new projects will be published there.
