# The 1PPM Challenge

[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/1ppm/challenge](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/1ppm/challenge)


1PPM is a challenge for developers, makers and creatives. Its about accelerated learning, avoiding over engineering and getting things done. Find out more about the 1PPM in "[The 1PPM-Challenge](https://medium.com/1ppm/the-1ppm-challenge-eaed5df0ef5a#.oejtaqmy0)"

## Get Started!

Here is an Article on how to come up with project ideas: "[12 Months / 12 Side Projects - Are you in?](https://medium.com/@gerji/12-months-12-side-projects-are-you-in-c395dbcd648e#.qle34253j)". Note that a 1PPM project can be anything, as long as it has a result, you learned something and is a one month project. So it could be an article, an online course certificate, a github project etc. Contributions to [open source projects](https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/how-to-contribute-to-open-source)  are especially welcome!


To get started:

1. Fork this repository
2. Start a new section in [HallOfFame.md](HallOfFame.md) with your name/nickname as title and add a description of your projects + links to repository or articles  
3. Make a [pull request](http://kbroman.org/github_tutorial/pages/fork.html) to merge your changes back

For any questions or feedback, contact [1ppm@1ppm.club](mailto:1ppm@1ppm.club). You can also follow [@1ppmclub](https://twitter.com/1ppmclub) on twitter, all new projects will be published there.

We are excited to hear from your projects!

PS.: Looking for collaborators, want to discuss ideas or improve 1PPM - feel free to use the *issue tracker*!

## 01.01.2017 - Let's Get Started!

Hello 1PPM Community,

Today (8AM), we are already counting 135 forks of the 1PPM Log repository. This means, the 1PPM community could create up to **1620 new projects** in 2017! Now that would be exciting!

Thanks to your engagement, 1PPM even made it to the [GitHub trending page](https://github.com/trending) yesterday. Don't forget to star and tell your friends, maybe we can do that again.

For my 01/2017 project, I am going to create a first version of a 1ppm.club website. Minimum: *A JavaScript Page with the HallOfFame page as its "Backend", hosted on Github Pages, live by Jan 31 (latest).* (see [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/1ppm/1ppmLog/issues/9)). Collaborators are welcome, just contact me via [1ppm@1ppm.club](mailto:1ppm@1ppm.club) or [chat]((https://gitter.im/1ppm/challenge)).

Also, I am announcing a **1PPM logo design contest** since Scott Hutchenson challenged my mighty MS Paint skills with his fancy photoshopping:

<img src="logo/1PPM_Logo.png" width="200" height="150" />
<img src="logo/scott_hutchensen.jpg" width="200" height="150" />

Simply add your submissions to the "logo" folder with name/nickname as filename. **Voting starts on Jan. 7**, probably via Twitter survey.

Happy new year and keep going:  
Set a goal, build, release, learn, repeat :)

Regards,  
Gerhard

## 01.01.2017 - POD, chat, project ideas

Hello 1PPM Community,

 As announced, the 1PPM Bot (which is me at first) will publish new projects via [@1ppmclub](https://twitter.com/1ppmclub) and later in Slack (see issue #23). Probably in the evening (CET) when he has the time ;) Everyday the Bot will pick one or more projects as "project(s) of the day" (#POD) so that everyone can be POD once a month. Feel free to discuss the project ideas, offer contributions and ask for advice, there will be a #pod channel in Slack. (Please be kind, find some tips on giving feedback [here](https://www.roberthalf.com/creativegroup/blog/7-tips-on-giving-feedback-to-employees))

 As mentioned before, there will move from gitter to Slack, reasons see #23. I am working on an easier invitation method, early adopters can contact me via email (1ppm@1ppm.club, Subject: Slack).

There are two ideas for 1PPM open for volunteers who are  looking for projects: #38 a 1ppm Bot and #39 a HallOfFame to JSON parser. Questions and voluntary notifications in the issue tracker.

Regards,  
Gerhard
